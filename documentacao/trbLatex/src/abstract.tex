The Problem of Eight Queens is the logical challenge to have eight pieces (queens) on a chessboard (traditional $8x8 $) so that no is attacked by another. Thus, it is necessary that any two queens are not in the same row, column or diagonal. The problem has 92 distinct solutions that in fact these are 12 unique solutions where we get the other solutions by symmetry operations (rotation and reflection). This project will submit an application that manages the placement of the eight queens, one at a time on the chessboard. The player can insert and remove each queen of this board by coordinates (ranging from "$a$"  to  "$h$" and $1$ to $8$, as the international standard). Every movement, see and tell the player where the first attack occurred. Sinalizaremos when the problem is resolved. We stress that this application will not catalog the 92 possible solutions, but check if the current stage of resolution consistent with the restrictions of the proposed problem.
